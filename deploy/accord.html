            The word "accord", when used as a verb, means "to grant power or authority", and in this case,
            power is being granted to the customer. Accord is a brand of chocolate that not only offers
            regular chocolates but also allows the customer to decide the ratio of chocolate to chocolate
            inclusions. I enjoy cookies and cream products such as chocolate and milkshakes a
            lot, so after eating said products for a while, I noticed that sometimes, the ratio of cookies
            to cream was either too much or too little. I also saw this reflected among other chocolate inclusions
            like caramel or nougat. So I decided to create a luxury chocolate brand that allows the customer to
            have a say in how they like their chocolate, as opposed to how most chocolate companies pick a single
            ratio and the mass-produce it.

            I wanted the logo and packaging to reflect the idea of a customer choosing different ratios
            in their order. The logo is made up of three different colored "layers", representing the different
            ratios. This design choice is reflected again on each shelf of the package. Each chocolate is a 3x3x3"
            cube, remaining uniform with both the package and the logo. The logo and wordmark are simple, while the
            package is matte to give the product a high-end feel. I created the logo and package design in Figma. I
            moved the die line to Illustrator, so it could be cut out by a laser cutter. The package is made of mostly
            blackboard and is held together with a polyurethane adhesive. Since the blackboard used is thick, each piece
            is individual (as opposed to creating a die line with folds) to uphold the structural integrity. The featured 
            flavor is cookies and cream.
