    <li class="project-body-text">
        The word 'accord' when used as a verb means 'to grant power or authority', and in this case,
        power is being granted to the customer. Accord is a brand of chocolate that not only offers
        regular chocolates but allows the customer to decide the ratio of chocolate to chocolate
        inclusions. I enjoy cookies and cream products such as chocolate, ice cream and milkshakes a
        lot, so after eating said products for a while, I nopticed that sometimes, the ratio of coookies
        to cream was either too much or too little. I also saw this reflected among other chocolate inclusions
        like caramel or nougat. So I decided to create a luzury chocolate brand that allows the customer to
        have a say in how they'e like their chocolate, as opposed to how most chocolate companies pick a single
        ratio and the mass produce it.

        For this project, the featured flavor is the cookies & cream flavor. 
        edition. Each box contains three sections, each section holding nine cubes of chocolate.
        The addition of ribbons as tabs gives the package a luxury touch.
