        The word "accord" when used as a verb means "to grant power or authority", and in this case,
        power is being granted to the customer. Accord is a brand of chocolate that not only offers
        regular chocolates but allows the customer to decide the ratio of chocolate to chocolate
        inclusions. I enjoy cookies and cream products such as chocolate, ice cream and milkshakes a
        lot, so after eating said products for a while, I nopticed that sometimes, the ratio of coookies
        to cream was either too much or too little. I also saw this reflected among other chocolate inclusions
        like caramel or nougat. So I decided to create a luxury chocolate brand that allows the customer to
        have a say in how they'e like their chocolate, as opposed to how most chocolate companies pick a single
        ratio and the mass produce it.

        I wanted the logo and packaging to reflect the idea of a customer choosing different ratios
        in their order. The logo is made up of three different colored "layers", representing the different
        ratios. This design choise is reflected again on each shelf of the package. Each chocolate is a 3x3x3"
        cube, remaining uniform with both the package and the logo. The logo and wordmark are simple while the
        package is matte to give the product a high-end feel. The featured flavor is cookies and cream.
