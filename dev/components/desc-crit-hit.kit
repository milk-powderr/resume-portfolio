            Video games are one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the modern
            world, from as far back as Pacman to newer releases like Genshin Impact. But
            have we taken time out to study how they affect us psychologically? People
            have different reasons for gaming: from letting steam off to simply enjoying
            a virtual space with friends. This issue of this magazine gives its readers a
            closer look at the possible effects that this hobby may have on them, be it positive or negative.

            The magazine is made up of a front cover, spine, table of contents, and a few pages
            of the article I selected. The text in the magazine was pulled from an article
            online, as per the regulations for the assignment. The cover page is made up of
            cropped photos of both people and video game characters to show the relationship
            between both parties. The barcode is also shaped like a video game controller to give
            it some character. Photography played a large role throughout the magazine, from the
            collage of photos to the two outstretched hands on the spine. Transparent
            thumbtacks were used to add a sense of physical depth to the overall design.
