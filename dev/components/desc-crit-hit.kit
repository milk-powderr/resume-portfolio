        Video games are one of the most popular form of entertainment in the modern
        world, fram as far-back as Pacman to newer releases like Genshin Impact. But
        have we taken time out so study how they affect us psychologically? People
        have different reasons for gaming: from letting steam off to simply enjoying
        a virtual space with friends. This issue of this magazine gives its readers a
        closer look on the possible effects that this hobby in particular may have on
        them, be it positive or negative.

        The magazine is made up of a front cover, spine, table of contents and a few pages
        of the article I selected. The text in the magazine was pulled from an article
        online, as per the regulations for the assignment.
