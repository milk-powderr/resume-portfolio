            Video games are one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the modern
            world, from as far back as Pac-Man to newer releases like Genshin Impact. But
            have we taken time out to study how they affect us psychologically? People
            have different reasons for gaming: from letting steam off to simply enjoying
            a virtual space with friends. This issue of this magazine gives its readers a
            closer look at the possible effects that this hobby may have on them, be it positive or negative.
