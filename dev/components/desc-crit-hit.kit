        Video games are one of the most popular form of entertainment in the modern
        world, fram as far-back as Pacman to newer releases like Genshin Impact. But
        have we taken time out so study how they affect us psychologically? People
        have different reasons for gaming: from letting steam off to simply enjoying
        a virtual space with friends. This issue of this magazine gives its readers a
        closer look on the possible effects that this hobby in particular may have on
        them, be it positive or negative.

        The magazine is made up of a front cover, spine, table of contents and a few pages
        of the article I selected. The text in the magazine was pulled from an article
        online, as per the regulations for the assignment. The cover page is made up of
        cropped photos of both people and video game characters to show the relationship
        between both parties. The barcode is also shaped like a video game controler to give
        it some character. Photography played a large role throughout the magazine, from the
        collage of photos to the two outstretched hands on the spine. The use of transparent
        thumbtacks were used to add a sense of physical depth to the overall design.
