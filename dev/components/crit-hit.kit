        Video games are one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the modern world, from as
        far back as Pac-Man to newer releases like Genshin Impact. People have different reasons for gaming:
        from letting off steam to more intense spaces like competitive/professional e-sports. But have we
        taken time out to study how they affect us psychologically?  This issue of this magazine gives its
        readers a closer look at the possible effects that this hobby may have on them, be it positive or negative.

        The name of the magazine is "Crit Hit", a shortened ersion of the gaming term "critical hit", which refers
        to an attacks that deals bonus damage. The cover is made up of cut outs of eyes of both real people and 
        characters from games. The barcode is shaped like a gaming controller in a bid to keep in theme with the 
        contents of the magazine.
