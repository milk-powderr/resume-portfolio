        Video games are one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the modern
        world, from as far back as Pac-Man to newer releases like Genshin Impact. But
        have we taken time out to study how they affect us psychologically? People
        have different reasons for gaming: from letting steam off to simply enjoying
        a virtual space with friends. This issue of this magazine gives its readers a
