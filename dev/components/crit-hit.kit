        Video games are one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the modern world, from as
        far back as Pac-Man to newer releases like Genshin Impact. People have different reasons for gaming:
        from letting off steam to more intense spaces like competitive/professional e-sports. But have we
        taken time out to study how they affect us psychologically?  This issue of this magazine gives its
        readers a closer look at the possible effects that this hobby may have on them, be it positive or negative.

        Since Bartram's Garden is involved in agriculture, horticulture and apiculture, those three elements
        were taken into consideration when designing a new logo. The hexagonal leaf, flower, and honeycomb cell
        motifs are used repeatedly throughout the brand. Items such as flyers, merchandise, and environmental
        branding are included to remind viewers of Bartram's Garden's main areas of operation. The logo animation
        was made with code (HTML, CSS, Javascript, and GSAP), while the logo and other elements were developed in
        Illustrator.
