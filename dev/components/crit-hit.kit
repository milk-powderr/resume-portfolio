        Video games are one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the modern world, from as
        far back as Pac-Man to newer releases like Genshin Impact. People have different reasons for gaming:
        From letting off steam to more intense spaces like competitive/professional e-sports. But have we
        taken time out to study how they affect us psychologically? This issue of this magazine gives its
        readers a closer look at the possible effects that this hobby may have on them, whether positive or negative.

        The name of the magazine is "Crit Hit", a shortened version of the gaming term "critical hit", which refers
        to an attack that deals bonus damage. The cover is made up of cutouts of eyes of both real people and 
        characters from games. The barcode is shaped like a gaming controller in a bid to keep in theme with the 
        contents of the magazine. The spine has an image of someone reaching out to grab a controller from someone 
        else's hand, signifying how gaming has connected people over time. One of the pages has white negative spaces
        in the shape of a triangle to represent what has universally been accepted as the "play" button. Another spread 
        has images of pictures that have been held down by transparent thumbtacks. The thumbtacks cast a shadow on the 
        page, even bleeding into the body copy to really push the three-dimensional effect. Each of the aforementioned
        pictures are made up of a combination of two pictures with contrasting themes, for example, a light-hearted
        and casual game like <span id="name-italics">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span> combined with a gloomy
        image of someone lying on a bed with their head down.
