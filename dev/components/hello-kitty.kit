        Hello Kitty® and Friends is a a group of characters created by the Japanese company Sanrio,
        with Hello Kitty being the most iconic one. This project focused on creating protoypes of
        party supplies and packaging themed after the aforementioned characters. I built mockups of
        headbands, stickers, jointed banners, and centerpiece decorations.

        I recieved the files from the design team and prepared them for print in Illustrator before
        sending them to the large format color printer. I then applied the appropriate adhesives to
        adhere them to weighted paper. Some of the products required glitter so I applied PVA glue to
        the necessary parts before adding the glitter, and allowed the glue to cure for 24 hours. after
        mocking up the products, I mockeed up the headers for the packaging and paired said packages to
        products accordingly.
