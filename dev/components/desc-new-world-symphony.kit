            Antonín Leopold Dvořák (8 September 1841 – 1 May 1904) was a Czech composer who created pieces
            heavily influenced by folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia. This poster in particular
            is to advertise one of his most popular pieces, Symphony No. 9 in E minor, "From the New World",
            Op. 95, B. 178 (Czech: Symfonie č. 9 e moll "Z nového světa"), popularly known as the New World
            Symphony

            The magazine is made up of a front cover, spine, table of contents and a few pages
            of the article I selected. The text in the magazine was pulled from an article
            online, as per the regulations for the assignment. The cover page is made up of
            cropped photos of both people and video game characters to show the relationship
            between both parties. The barcode is also shaped like a video game controler to give
            it some character. Photography played a large role throughout the magazine, from the
            collage of photos to the two outstretched hands on the spine. The use of transparent
            thumbtacks were used to add a sense of physical depth to the overall design.
