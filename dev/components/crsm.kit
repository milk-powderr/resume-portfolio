            Charisma (カリスマ) is a Japanese music multimedia project, created by King Records under their EVIL LINE
            RECORDS label. The characters were designed by Ebimo, with Shu Matsubara as the main scenario writer.
            The project began on August 7, 2021, telling a story of 7 housemates living under one roof. The
            series currently focuses on music and drama tracks. It also has two mangas, and a stage play.

            I began with low-fidelity designs in Figma, properly fleshing them out in desktop, tablet, and mobile views
            before bringing my design into Webflow. For some aspects such as the marquees, I had to use custom code
            since Webflow doesn't have animation tools.
