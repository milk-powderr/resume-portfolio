        Charisma (カリスマ) is a Japanese music multimedia project, created by King Records under their EVIL LINE
        RECORDS label. The characters were designed by Ebimo, with Shu Matsubara as the main scenario writer.
        The project began on August 7, 2021, telling a story of 7 housemates living under one roof. The
        series currently focuses on music and drama tracks. It also has two mangas, and a stage play.

        I began with low-fidelity designs in Figma, properly fleshing them out in desktop, tablet, and mobile views
        before bringing my design into Webflow. For some aspects such as the marquees, I had to use custom code
        since Webflow doesn't have animation tools.
