            This screenprint is based on Episode 116: 'Something Blue' from the bi-weekly podcast 'Lore'.
            The podcast tells the story of how a woman scammed hundreds of wealthy people by making them
            believe that extreme fasting was the way to cure the body of 'all possible diseases'.
