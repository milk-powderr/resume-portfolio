            This screenprint is based on Episode 116: 'Something Blue' from the bi-weekly podcast 'Lore'.
            The podcast tells the story of how a woman scammed hundreds of wealthy people by making them
            believe that extreme fasting was the way to cure the body of 'all possible diseases'.

        <li class="objective-2">
            I decided to create a menu bar for an application belonging to a pastry store. I chose to
            design it to look like a square-shaped cake that had the layers exposed. The three berries
            falling from the top add an interesting feature to the design. All elements were made in Figma
            and the animation was done with code.
