            Bartram's Garden is the oldest survivng botanical garden in North America. It is located
            in Southwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The aim of this project is to give it a new
            brand identity, encluding but not limited to a new logo, website, merchandise and more.

        <li class="bartram-objective-2">
            The goal of this project was to give Bartram's Garden a more modern and upbeat identity. Since Bartram's
            Garden is involved with horticulture and apiculture, those two elements were taken into consideration
            when designing a new logo. The hexagon, flower and leaf motifs were used repeatedly in the new brand
            identity. Items such as flyers, merchandise and environmental branding were included to enhance the
            authenticity of the design.
