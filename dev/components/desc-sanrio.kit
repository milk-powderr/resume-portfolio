            Nuigurumis (Japanese for 'stuffed toy' or 'plush toy') are merchandise pieces produced for media such
            as games and animes. They are very popular in Japan and are usually placed in crane machines. When
            collected, they can be used as charms, decorations or, simply for display. Sometimes collectors go the
            extra mile and create accessories and clothes for them.

        <li class="objective-body">
            The clothes are made up of mostly single stitches while the band around the hat is made up of half-double
            crotchets. The ears are stuffed with stuffing before being sewn on with a crocheting needle. They are
            gone over with a regular crocheting pin to reinforce the structural integrity. All other accessories are sewn on.
