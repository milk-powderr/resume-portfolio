        This project covered party supplies under Unique Industries, Inc.'s own brand for "Everyday"
        occassions. I built mock-ups of paper banners, packages and completed digital mock-ups as well.

        I recieved the files from the design team and prepared them for print in Illustrator before
        sending them to the large format color printer. I then applied the appropriate adhesives to
        adhere them to weighted paper before cutting them out and mocking them up before pairing the
        mocked-up products with the appropriate mocked-up packages.
