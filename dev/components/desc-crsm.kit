            Charisma (カリスマ) is a Japanese music multimedia project, created by King Records under their EVIL LINE
            RECORDS label. The characters were designed by Ebimo, with Shu Matsubara as the main scenario writer.
            The project began on August 7, 2021, telling a story of 7 housemates living under one roof. The
            series currently focuses on music and drama tracks. It also has two mangas, and a stage play.

            Since OREO is an existing brand, it was necessary to follow their brand style guides: the font and color to
            use, how the cookie can be oriented, what wording is appropriate, and so on. This project began
            with a storyboard in Figma so there could be a proper roadmap for the animation. All assets of this project
            were made in Figma and the animation was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP. The phrases 'OREO
            COOKIES JUST WANNA DUNK' and 'Wonderfilled' were used to stay in line with the brand's playful and inviting
            tone.
