            Our environemt is currently being plagues with all sort of tragedies: climate change, rising sea levels,
            ozone layer depletion and so on. But very few individuals are aware on what these effects could have
            on the diversity of marine life over the next few years.

            This exhibition in particular focuses on the effects that pollution has on marin biodiversity. The images
            were put together with both Figma and Adobe Illustrator and a digital 3-D model was built alongside it in
            SketchUp. The placards are made of acrylic and a section of the wall has an interactive feature where there
            is a button that visitors can press which pushes air bubbles upwards, making the trash in the water float.
