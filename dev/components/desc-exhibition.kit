            Our environment is currently being plagued with all sorts of tragedies: climate change, rising sea levels,
            ozone layer depletion, and so on. However, very few individuals are aware of what these effects could have
            on the diversity of marine life over the next few years.

            The placards are made of acrylic and a section of the wall has an interactive feature where there
            is a button that visitors can press which pushes air bubbles upwards, making the trash in the water float.
            The 'Marine Biodiversity' placard is filled with colorful sand and the image on the floor is made
            from vinyl.
