            This screenprint is based on Episode 116: 'Something Blue' from the bi-weekly podcast 'Lore'.
            The podcast tells the story of how a woman scammed hundreds of wealthy people by making them
            believe that extreme fasting was the way to cure the body of 'all possible diseases'.

            I decided to use a picture of chewable vitamins. I edited them in Photoshop to reduce them to
            three 'layers'. The paper at the bottom was also edited to include a half-tone effect which
            was transferred to a silk screen along with the image of pills.
