            The theme I selected for the images is 'patience', as the images depict actions or occurrences
            that usually require a long amount of time eg. waiting for paint to dry, the ripening process
            of bell pepper, knitting a quilt, etc.

        <li class="objective-body">
            I created some of the images such as the ones with paint by myself and sourced the other ones 
            from the Internet.
