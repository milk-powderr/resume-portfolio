            Feature like a toggle switches or menu bars are essential to programs such as applications
            and websites, but they can become so much more when character is given to them.

        <li class="bbread-objective-2">
            I decided to create a toggle switch that resembled a baking hot cross bun. The bun goes through
            the motion of being baked to represent the 'on/off' function. For the menu bar, I designed a
            menu bar for an application belonging to a pastry store. I designed it to look like a square-shaped
            cake that had the layers exposed. The three berriesfalling from thetop add anvariety to the design.
