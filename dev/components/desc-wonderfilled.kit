            Antonín Leopold Dvořák (8 September 1841 – 1 May 1904) was a Czech composer who created pieces
            heavily influenced by folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia. This poster in particular
            is to advertise one of his most popular pieces, Symphony No. 9 in E minor, "From the New World",
            Op. 95, B. 178 (Czech: Symfonie č. 9 e moll "Z nového světa"), popularly known as the New World
            Symphony. A tape recording of it was taken by Neil Armstrong into space on the Apollo 11 Mission.
            The piece is nicknamed 'The New World' because he wrote it during his time in the United States
            while simultaneously longing for his home.

            The text on the poster has been manipulated to imitate the view of an astronaut has from space.
            The information for the time and location of the concert are shaped like eliptical galaxies, while
            the title 'New World Symphony' is repeated in shades of green, brown and blue to represent the Earth's
            surface.
