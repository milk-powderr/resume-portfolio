            This project aimed to depict the steps taken to make a cake in a machine assembly fashion.
            This project was inspired by the game 'Purble Place', a computer game where you can bake
            and deliver a cake on a conveyor belt. The instructions on the map were made to be easily
            digestible while having a playful tone.
