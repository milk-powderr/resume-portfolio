        The theme I selected for the images is 'patience', as the images depict actions or occurrences
        that usually require a long amount of time, e.g. waiting for paint to dry, the ripening process
        of bell pepper, knitting a quilt, etc.

        I created some of the images, such as the ones with paint, by myself and sourced the other ones
        from the Internet. As for the images I created, I focused on getting close-up shots of splashes of drying 
        acrylic paint and pencil sharpenings, both materials that take time to produce.
