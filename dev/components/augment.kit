        This design is the 'gift' series named 'Iris', which means, 'rainbow' in Ancient Greek.
        This name was chosen based on the iridescent appearance of the cutlery. The colored band
        that runs around the package would have a different color based on the theme of the
        cutlery set. The outside of the packaging has a sleek appearance to create a balance
        with the busier interior of the package. The utensils are tied down with black elastic
        bands to prevent them from shifting about and the pattern repeated on the interior is
        made known on the sides of the exterior of the package.
