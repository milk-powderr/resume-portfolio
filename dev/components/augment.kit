        I've always felt that the kind of cutlery used while eating can greatly determine whether
        someone will enjoy a meal or not. I've always liked plastic or brightly colored metal utensils
        with rounded edges, so I created a package based on my favorite set of cutlery. Augment
        produces cutlery sets for different occasions or themes such as New Year's Day, Independence Day,
        graduations, housewarming, and so on.

        This design is the "gift" series named "Iris", which means "rainbow" in Ancient Greek.
        This name was chosen based on the iridescent appearance of the cutlery. The packaging style is 
        called a "shoulder box", where part of the inner package is purposely exposed.
        It's commonly used in luxury products such as headphones of fragrances. The colored band
        that runs around the package would have a different color based on the theme of the
        cutlery set. For this set, I chose iridescent foil. The exterior of the packaging has a simple,
        almost minimalist appearance to create a balance with the busier interior of the package. The
        utensils are tied down with black elastic bands to prevent them from shifting about. The motifs
        on the interior are repeated on the sides of the exterior of the package. I created the logo and
        package design in Figma. I moved the die line to Illustrator, so it could be cut out by a laser
        cutter. The package is made of mostly blackboard and is held together with a polyurethane adhesive.
        Since the blackboard used is thick, each piece is individual (as opposed to creating a die line with
        folds) to uphold the structural integrity.
