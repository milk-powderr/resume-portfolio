        Nuigurumis (Japanese for 'stuffed toy' or 'plush toy') are merchandise pieces produced for media such
        as games and anime. They are very popular in Japan and are usually placed in crane machines. When
        collected, they can be used as charms, decorations, or simply for display. Sometimes collectors go the
        extra mile and create accessories and clothes for them.

        The clothes are made up of mostly single stitches, while the band around the hat is made up of half-double
        stitches. The ears are stuffed with stuffing before being sewn on with a crocheting needle. They are
        reinforced with a regular crocheting pin to strengthen the structural integrity. All other accessories are sewn
        on.
