        "Slap" is a brand of citrus-flavored energy drinks. This project is a 4-pack that contains
        four different flavors: lemon, key lime, mandarin, and grapefruit.

        The name "Slap" is attributed to the bite of sourness from citrus fruits that is akin to getting
        slapped in the face. The logo and images of sliced citrus fruit have a pixelated appearance to embody 
        the sharp taste of citrus fruits. There are also plus sign images, representations of the energy boost 
        received after consuming the drink. The die line of the package is a single sheet, making it easy for assembly 
        and for commercial shipping in large amounts. The package has a tab lock top and a crash lock bottom. The 
        four-color citrus slice present on both the top and bottom of the package represents how each pack holds a 
        variety of four different flavors.
