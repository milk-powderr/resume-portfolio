        <li class="objective-body">
            'SLAP' is a brand of citrus-flavored energy drinks. This project is a 4-pack that contains
            four different flavors: lemon, key lime, mandarin, and grapefruit.

            The name 'SLAP' is derived from the Nigerian slang 'slappy', which is used to describe sour food
            such as citrus fruit since the bite of sourness is sometimes akin to getting slapped in the face.
            The package has a tab lock top and a crash lock bottom. The images of fruit slices and plus-signs
            along with the logo have a pixellated look to them to attribute to the fact that this is an energy
            drink.
