        <li class="objective-body">
            The word 'accord' when used as a verb means 'to grant power or authority.' Accord was created
            to give 'power' to the customer, and in this case, it's the power to choose the amount of
            chocolate inclusions in your desired product. The featured version is the cookies & cream
            edition. Each box contains three sections, each section holding nine cubes of chocolate.
            The addition of ribbons as tabs gives the package a luxury touch.
