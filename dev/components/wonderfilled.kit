        OREO is one of the most recognizable cookie brands in America if not the whole world. The OREO cookie
        comes in many flavors and sizes. Sometimes they're covered in chocolate, come in the form of an
        ice cream, and have even been adapted into drinks. At the end of the day, it all comes down to the original
        humble cookie: white cream sandwiched by two charcoal-colored disks.
