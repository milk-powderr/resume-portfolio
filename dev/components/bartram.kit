        Bartram's Garden is the oldest surviving botanical garden in North America. It is located in
        Southwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This project aims to give it a new brand identity,
        including but not limited to a new logo, website, merchandise, and more.

    <li class="project-body-text">
        Since Bartram's Garden is involved with horticulture and apiculture, those two elements were taken into
        consideration when designing a new logo. The hexagon, flower, and leaf motifs are used repeatedly
        throughout the brand. Items such as flyers, merchandise, and environmental branding are included to enhance
        the authenticity of the design.
